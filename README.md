# cryptoDiscordBot
To build this bot I used a youtube turtorial and followed it to be able to set price alerts for crypto. I added a function that calculates rsi and multiple functions calling other pieces of data however the set rsi alert is still in beta. The turtorial's discord bot can only set price alerts using integers with a base ten. However, I like smaller cyrpto currencies like cardano so I needed my bot to be able to read floats which I fixed. I also linked my crptoBot to bot ghost so it can run indefinetly.
