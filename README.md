# cryptoDiscordBot
To build this bot I used a youtube turtorial and followed it to be able to set price alerts for crypto. I added a function that calculates rsi and multiple functions calling other pieces of data however the function that set an alert for rsi changes is still in beta and only works conditionally. Additoionally, the turtorial's discord bot can only set price alerts for integers with a base ten. I like smaller cyrpto currencies like cardano so I needed my bot to be able to read floats which I fixed. I also linked my cryptoBot to bot ghost so it can run indefinetly. The catch for this bot is that it has to be run on Replit.com since my code relies on the replit database function for storing values from the api and discord inputs.
